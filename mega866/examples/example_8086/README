The 8086_core.py module takes care of handling the bus interactions with the 8086.
Currently, the public interface of this module consists of 4 functions:

def read_memory(address, width)
def write_memory(address, data)
def read_io(address, width)
def write_io(address, data)

where width is an instance of the IoWidth enum.
